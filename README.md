# Generate Grid
A simple add-in that will allow you to easily generate a grid or checkerboard pattern.

It is based on BoltBait's Grid Maker v3.0 plugin for Paint.net.

##Notes

- It has lib copies of the current Pinta.Core and Pinta.Effects and Pinta.Gui.Widgets to build against, and they currently need manual updating. (Need to look into automatic updates here.)

- It builds a single dll that needs to be copied to Pinta's bin folder 
(when developing) or Pinta's install folder (installed Pinta).

##Translations

Anyone wishing to contribute translations can do so by editing ```GenerateGridAddin/.addin.xml``` and adding translated strings there, using the "en" translation strings as examples.

##Bugs

All bugs should be reported to the issue tracker on this Github page.
