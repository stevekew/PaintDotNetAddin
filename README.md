# Paint.net Addin
=================

This addin provides support for the [Paint.net (*.pdn) file format] [1].

##Notes

- It has lib copies of the current Pinta.Core and Mono.Addins to build against, and they currently need manual updating. (Need to look into automatic updates here.)

- It builds a single dll that needs to be copied to Pinta's bin folder (when developing) or Pinta's install folder (installed Pinta).


##Bugs

All bugs should be reported to the issue tracker on this Github page, not to the main Pinta bug tracker.

As with the rest of Pinta, this is licensed under the MIT/X11 license.
